To convert existing working model to tfjs model :-
//After trainining and testing your model
//Note: model is <model name>
1) model.save("model.h5")
2) !pip install tensorflowjs
3) !tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras '/content/model.h5' '/content/model'

After doing this a content folder will be created, and model.json will be generated.


IMPORTANT POINTS:-
* To run the application, just open index.html and it will open
* It is recommended to load the webpage everytime you want to insert a new image for prediction
* The trained model for digital image is not very accurate. Better use some other model.


Conclusion :-
* Using a single model for both thermal and digital image can help in improved accuracy.
